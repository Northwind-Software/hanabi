# Hanabi

Hanabi is a blazingly fast and configurable message broker and event streaming
platform for all of your event-driven application needs.

It can do everything from simple pub/sub to complex message routing and data
persistence.

Hanabi is written in Rust, a safe, highly concurrent and performant programming
language. By leveraging Rust's powerful features, Hanabi is able to provide
a safe and flexible API that can be used across multiple other programming
languages thanks to WebAssembly.

Hanabi is currently in early development. Stay tuned for more information!
